# TTC_Subway_Delays_Tableau_Analysis

## Project Overview
TTC Subway Delays have been a major issue for Toronto's commuters for years. This analysis aims to use Tableau to visualize the data from 2014 to 2020, and identify key insights with respect to the trends of delays, main causes of the delays, and conclude with a number of course of action for TTC's management to undertake and improve its subway operations.

## Data Source

- TTC Subway Delay Data from Jan 2014 to Oct 2020: [City of Toronto Open Data](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-subway-delay-data/)

- TTC Monthly Ridership Data from Jan 2007 to Mar 2021 : [City of Toronto Open Data - Toronto's Dashboard](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/toronto-progress-portal/)


## Tools

- Data Transformation: Power Query, Excel

- Data Visualization: Tableau Public

## Data Transformation

- Both Delay Data and Ridership Data were downloaded from City of Torono Open Data as excel files.

- Data transformation, such as connecting to and appending all excel files together to produce a combined Delay Data csv file, and pivoting the Ridership Data for ease of use, were performed with Power Query.

- Please see the ReadMe File under the Data Transformation Folder for details.
